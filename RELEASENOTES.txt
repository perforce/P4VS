          It is important to make sure your Visual Studio installation
          has been updated to the latest available service pack.

        Compatibility with Previous Releases

          Unless otherwise stated below, this release of P4VS is compatible with
          previous releases from Perforce Software.

        Installation

          After installing with p4vs.vsix for Visual Studio, confirm that
          P4VS is the current source control plug-in by navigating to
          Tools -> Options -> Source Control -> Plug-in
          Selection and make sure that P4VS - Helix Plugin for
          Visual Studio is the selection in the drop down on that
          options page. If the plug-in does not appear in the drop
          down, confirm that it is enabled by checking the list of
          Installed Extensions in Tools -> Extension Manager, or
          Extensions -> Manage Extensions in Visual Studio 2019.

          To uninstall P4VS, use the Extension Manager via Tools ->
          Extension Manager, or Extensions -> Manage Extensions
          in Visual Studio 2019.. Select the P4VS extension in the
          list of installed extensions and click the Uninstall button.

          Silent installation from the command line:

          "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio <version #>\
          Common7\IDE\VSIXInstaller.exe" /q <path to>\p4vs<version#>.vsix

        Known Limitations

          When using File -> Move into -> <project> with a C++ project, if
          the file selected is currently marked for add a dialog may appear
          asking if the file should be deleted in the Depot (Files that are
          marked for add will be reverted). This is due to Visual Studio trying
          delete the file as part of the move. Select NO in this dialog if you
          want to keep the file marked for add.

          If the option "Warn before reverting files" is disabled and a file
          is reverted that is currently loaded in an editor, Visual Studio
          will not detect the change to the file and prompt to reload or
          ignore the changes. As a result, the reverted changes in the file
          will remain in the editor.

          If the connection dialog does not appear after Visual Studio
          upgrade, it is likely active but not on the screen. Use ALT+TAB
          to attempt to cycle to the Visual Studio application icon that
          is the P4VS connection dialog and attempt to restore, move, or
          maximize the dialog. If ALT+TAB does not allow access to the
          connection dialog, the related screen position saved preference may be
          edited or deleted. The settings file can be found in:
          C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Perforce\P4VS\localsettings.ini
          and the related lines in that file are:
                <OpenConnectionDlg_Width type="int">#</OpenConnectionDlg_Width>
                <OpenConnectionDlg_Height type="int">#</OpenConnectionDlg_Height>
                <OpenConnectionDlg_Top type="int">#</OpenConnectionDlg_Top>
                <OpenConnectionDlg_Left type="int">#</OpenConnectionDlg_Left>

          Integration functionality is limited to merge and copy while
          working in a Streams workspace.

          Performance issues may occur when connecting to a locally hosted
          server and using localhost in the server field for the
          connection. To avoid this, use the IP address of the machine or
          127.0.0.1 instead.

          If when opening a P4VS options page, the message "An error
          occurred loading this property page" appears, Cancel out of the
          options pages and bring them up again to restore the page.

          If connecting to a unicode Perforce server, the Arial Unicode
          Microsoft font must be installed in order to properly display all
          unicode characters in P4VS.

          Opening a new project when a current solution is opened and
          unsaved may result in an "Error closing solution" error message
          if the "Save as..." prompt is canceled. The new project will not
          be opened. To open a new project and not save the currently
          opened solution, close the solution via File -> Close Solution
          and select "No" when prompted to save.

          Clicking View -> View in P4V on a file that has non-ASCII
          characters in its path will result in a "paths do not exist"
          error being returned from P4V.

          The View actions for P4VS (e.g. View -> View in P4V) use P4V
          launched with a command. On Windows, Japanese systems use code
          page 932. CP932 is Microsoft's extended version of ShiftJis; it
          also includes the NEC special characters. When using ShiftJis on
          Windows, you have to instruct Qt 4.8.+ to use CP932 and the
          extension, instead of plain ShiftJis, to avoid mojibake. You need
          to set the following environment variable:
               UNICODEMAP_JP=cp932,nec-vdc
          Then, when P4V or P4Merge runs, it will use the modified ShiftJis
          (CP932) implementation, and apply the extension to recognize NEC
          special characters when encoding/decoding characters.

          When loading a large project under Perforce control, if
          directories containing a large number of files are in an expanded
          state during load, the opening of the project may take
          considerably longer to complete. To avoid this issue, collapse
          expanded directories before closing the IDE.

        #2493034, #2493068 (Job #117444) *
            During solution/project load, Visual Studio queries for the icons 
            of the files. And the icons are decided based upon whether the 
            respective file is included in any of the project or not. This 
            patch improvises the algorithm behind this to improve P4VS solution 
            load performance.

            During solution/project load, Visual Studio queried for the file
            state for virtual files which are linked from a different physical
            location.This caused a substantial numbers of wasteful server calls
            which degraded P4VS performance. This fix aims to workaround that
            issue and improve P4VS solution load performance
            
        #2470221, #2467811 (Job #116619) *
            Increased the default value for 'Check server updates for every' (in

What's New (2015.1)

        "Lazy Load" feature to cut down load time and general performance
	on large projects and/or slow connections.

        The online and local help have been updated with the following
        text to provide guidance for which performance tuning features to
        use base on the speed of the connection and the size of the solution
        loaded.

        "Note: The Treat Solution/Projects as directories when selected,
        Preload file state, and Lazy load file state options are used to
        tune the performance of P4VS for your environment. If none of
        these options are selected, P4VS will load the metadata for each
        file individually. Unless you have a small project you should look
        to use one of these options.

        "* Treat Solution/Projects as directories when selected: Select to
        treat solutions and projects as directories when P4VS runs Perforce
        commands.

        "Use this option to improve performance when working with solutions
        that contain a large number of projects or files. Do not use this
        option if the directories in the solution contain a large number of
        other Perforce controlled files that are not included in the solution.

        "This option does not require that all the files and directories
        referenced by the solution are under the solution directory.

        "* Preload file state: Select to preload the metadata for all of the
        files in the perforce depot in or under the directory containing the
        solution file.

        "Use this option to improve performance when loading small to medium
        sized solutions where all the files that make up the solution are
        under the solution root. Only use this when there are few if any
        files under the solution root that are Perforce controlled that are
        not part of the solution.

        "This option tends to work best with solutions and projects created
        and managed by Visual Studio. Do not use this option if the files for
        the solution are intermixed in directories with large numbers of other
        Perforce controlled files. This option will provide little improvement
        in performance if most of the files composing the solution are outside
        of the solution root.

        "* Lazy load file state: Select to only load the Perforce metadata
        files in the solution as they are operated on using P4VS.

        "With this option, Perforce metadata for a file is only retreived from
        the server when you select a P4VS operation on a file. At that point,
        the Perforce metadata will be obtained from the server, the operation
        performed, and the Perforce metadata updated to reflect the results of
        the operation. When this option is selected, the file will by badged in
        the solution explorer to indicate that its status is unknown (in Visual
        Studio 2010, this will be a blank badge). After a Perforce operation is
        performed on a file it will be badged to indicate its current state.

        "Use this option to improve performance loading large to very large sized
        solutions where you are interested in only working on a few select files.
        This is best for solutions and projects which include large amounts of code
        from libraries or frameworks, large numbers of asset files such as graphical
        elements for a game, or large numbers of files that are generated by another
        development system or plugin. This option is also useful in situations where
        the connection to the Perforce server is over a slow network or VPN.

        "* Full menu: Select to allow the full P4VS menu to be displayed on files
        that have not had their metadata loaded.

        "This option is displayed if the Lazy load file state option is enabled. This
        allows you to perform an operation on a file before P4VS loads its state. If
        this option is not selected, you are given the option to refresh the file which
        will load the metadata of the file from the server and then enable the
        appropriate P4VS operations on that file. Please note that if you choose this
        option and perform P4VS operations on a file that are not valid based on its
        current state, you are very likely to get error messages back from those
        operations."

        1020819 (Job 77607) *
            Added a "Lazy Load" feature to cut down load time and
            general performance on large projects and/or slow connections.

        The help file has been expanded to include a section on how to tune
        the performance when loading a solution into VS as follows:

            Note: The Treat Solution/Projects as directories when selected, Preload
            file state, and Lazy load file state options are used to tune the
            performance of P4VS for your environment. If none of these options are

            the directories in the solution contain a large number of other Perforce
            controlled files that are not included in the solution.

            This option does not require that all the files and directories referenced
            by the solution are under the solution directory.

            Preload file state: Select to preload the metadata for all of the files in
            the perforce depot in or under the directory containing the solution file.

            Use this option to improve performance when loading small to medium sized
            solutions where all the files that make up the solution are under the solution
            root. Only use this when there are few if any files under the solution root that
            are Perforce controlled that are not part of the solution.

            This option tends to work best with solutions and projects created and managed by
            Visual Studio. Do not use this option if the files for the solution are intermixed
            in directories with large numbers of other Perforce controlled files. This option
            will provide little improvement in performance if most of the files composing the
            solution are outside of the solution root.

            Lazy load file state: Select to only load the Perforce metadata files in the
            solution as they are operated on using P4VS.

            With this option, Perforce metadata for a file is only retreived from the server
            when you select a P4VS operation on a file. At that point, the Perforce metadata
            will be obtained from the server, the operation performed, and the Perforce
            metadata updated to reflect the results of the operation. When this option is
            selected, the file will by badged in the solution explorer to indicate that its
            status is unknown (in Visual Studio 2010, this will be a blank badge). After a
            Perforce operation is performed on a file it will be badged to indicate its current
            state.

            Use this option to improve performance loading large to very large sized solutions
            where you are interested in only working on a few select files. This is best for
            solutions and projects which include large amounts of code from libraries or
            frameworks, large numbers of asset files such as graphical elements for a game, or
            large numbers of files that are generated by another development system or plugin.
            This option is also useful in situations where the connection to the Perforce server
            is over a slow network or VPN.

            Full menu: Select to allow the full P4VS menu to be displayed on files that have not
            had their metadata loaded.

            This option is displayed if the Lazy load file state option is enabled. This allows
            you to perform an operation on a file before P4VS loads its state. If this option is
            not selected, you are given the option to refresh the file which will load the
            metadata of the file from the server and then enable the appropriate P4VS operations
            on that file. Please note that if you choose this option and perform P4VS operations
            on a file that are not valid based on its current state, you are very likely to get
            error messages back from those operations.
